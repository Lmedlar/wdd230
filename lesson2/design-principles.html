                        <p>Webtoons is a collection of online comics that not only uses this principle, 
                        but depends on it for its website to look like it is. The comics are organized 
                        in these little squares, almost like a quilt before your stitch it together. Each 
                        one is lined up with its neighbor, resulting in a very clean look that is organized 
                        and polished.

                        <p>Oculus designed their page with plenty of white space in between
                        each set of information, allowing the website to breath. Each section is space
                        apart and given a gap. The design is also very clean and straighforward, little sections 
                        telling the audience about why their product is so great and worth buying. Everything is aligned 
                        and sharp.

                        <p>Nintendo has a signiture color, red. They use this very well in their 
                        website design by highlighting the most important information and buttons with that bright color.
                        They use it against a white background, allowing for the color to further pop. They also use size to 
                        contrast between what they deem more important for the viewer to see, making their different sections 
                        vary in size.
