                   <p style="text-indent: 40px">One in four students report being a victim of bullying in their lifetime.

                    With limited resources, intervention programs were once out of reach for many Idaho schools.
                    
                    But thanks to Department Chair and Professor for Counselor Education at Boise State University, Dr. Aida Midgett, that is an issue of the past.
                    
                    "A local school counselor reached out with bullying issues at her school," Dr. Aida Midgett explains. "And I said let's work together, let's partner and develop a program that works for you that is easy to implement and sustain, and that's how STAC came about."
                    
                    A decade since it's initial development, STAC is a bullying intervention program that empowers students through 4 intervention strategies.
                    
                    Teaching students to act as defenders on behalf of targets of bullying.
                    
                    "A really important piece of STAC is that we developed it intentionally to be brief and to be sustainable for schools and for all schools in the state of Idaho," Dr. Midgett explains.
                    
                    STAC is a 90 minute training that teaches students about what bullying is, and what it isn't.

                    "We share with them the four STAC strategies," Dr. Midgett explains.<br><br>
                    
                    1) Stealing the show - Students learn to use humor or distraction to interrupt a bullying situation.<br><br>
                    
                    2) Turning it over - Students identify safe adults at school to report bullying.<br><br>
                    
                    3) Accompanying others - Students learn to support a student who is a target of bullying.<br><br>
                    
                    4) Coaching compassion - Students learn to gently confront perpetrators safely and effectively.<br><br></p>
                    
                    <p style="text-indent: 40px">The training, backed by an Idaho Community Development Block Grant, is being implemented across the state.
                    
                    "We've moved into working in semi-rural areas and now most of our work takes place in rural Idaho," Dr. Midgett explains.
                    
                    And that's not all!
                    
                    Randomized, controlled trials show that STAC-trained students gain greater knowledge and awareness of bullying as well as greater confidence to intervene.
                    
                    "Our next step is to train teachers to support them in supporting students who intervene in bullying situations and who report bullying to them." Dr. MIdgett shares.
